QSrollArea - Acts differently to other widgets, will not scale correctly if you set a layout to it.
Instead, set WidgetResizable to True for the scroll area, set its widget to an empty QWidget,
and then when creating the layout to use for the window, *parent it to the QWidget*.
This forces the ScrollArea to respect the layouts dimensions.
